# Merge Conflicts & Conflict Resolution
### Research what causes merge conflicts in Git.
In a situation where you do some work in a branch and the branch is updated before you can merge then there will be a merge conflict if the same file has been updated.
i.e. you are working in an outdated branch.

### What caused the conflict?
The conflict was caused by the two branches having differing code in test_conflict.md, as such git did not know which one I wanted in the repo.

### How did you resolve it?
Using VS Code in built in conflict resolution I accepted the changes in main, merged the branches locally and then synced them to the cloud.

### What did you learn?
It is important to know how to resolve conflicts as it is not uncommon to experience conflicts.
