# What Do You Want to Learn & Contribute?
### What do you hope to learn from this internship?
I want to learn and experience what its like to work in the software industry. Even though I have learnt a good bit about what the industry is like I would like proper experience and a look into what happens in a company. I would also like to discover what gaps I have in my knowledge. Knowing this will help me further improve and round out my skillset as a software engineer.

### What skills are you most excited to develop?
Besides gaps that I have yet to discover, I am looking forward to developing my skills in software development. This is because I don't feel as confident in coding compared to my other skills and would like round out my skills. 

### What do you think you can contribute to the team?
I think I can contribute by always being willing to share ideas and contribute to discussion. I also have knowledge and experience with the software development process and am ready to jump straight into development.

### What is one area you feel less confident in that youâ€™d like to improve?
I also found my ability to do code reviews lacking when doing them during my course, often times I would only do small reviews and leave bigger and more complex ones to other members of my team. This led to me lagging behind in terms of code reviews, so I would like to improve in this.

### What does success in this internship look like for you?
To me, if I can proudly say that I enjoyed and learnt something from Focus Bear then I can consider my time here as an intern worthwhile and a success.
