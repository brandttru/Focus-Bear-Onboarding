# Company Overview & Reflection Assignments
### Why do you think Focus Bear was created?
Founder Jeremy found that other productivity apps were not working for him and wanted to make an app that combined the best of competing apps.

### What problem is Focus Bear solving?
A productivity catered towards people, mainly those with autism and ADHD, to focus on a task without getting distracted. It also helps with building good habits/routines with featuers such as a morning routine checklist or break reminders.

### Why do you think this mission is important?
This mission is important because recently a lot more people having been diagnosed with autism or ADHD as an adult. As such the demand for more products catering to this demographic is needed. Focus Bear is here to help this group with features designed to enhance focus and minimise some of the challenges they face.

### How does Focus Bearâ€™s work align with your personal values or interests?
I think an app like this useful for everyone and is really inclusive with its marketing. Although I don't personally know anyone with these challenges, I am well aware of some of the challenges faced by this group and admire the mission Focus Bear aims to achieve.

### Do you personally relate to any of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve?
Even though I have not been diagnosed with either ADHD or autism I do sometimes tend to give in to distractions and lose focus. For example, when I am doing an assignment and I don't feel the pressure of deadlines, I will often find myself distracted by my phone. I think Focus Bear's focus mode can help diminish any distracting thoughts that might make me want to use my phone and keep help me remain focused.
