# Research Assignment: Competitive Landscape
### What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?
Focus Bear is a productivity app catered towards those with ADHD or autism. Tiimo also caters towards ADHD, but the other apps do not cater to a specific audience and are just general productivity apps. 

Focus bear aims to be more flexibile in its features. Other apps seem to focus on a few key features. For example, Cold Turkey is focused on website blocking, Tiimo focuses on being a schedule planner.

Another advantage Focus Bear has it its pricing model. Focus Bear uses a subscription model for more advanced features but can still be used without payment. I tried out Cold Turkey and set up website blocking. Although it was effective at its purpose, I noticed it requires a one-time purchase for full access. Depending on how much use a user can get out of paying for it, then Cold Turkey would be the better app. But I feel Focus Bear has more useful features even at the free level.

Focus Bear prioritises neurodivergent users, offering a nuanced details that make it more comfortable for a neurodivergent user to use. This includes providing users with different online asssessments such as autism and ADHD tests.
### If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?
The main reason why I would choose Focus Bear is if I had autism or ADHD, I wanted an app that has a variety of features that other apps don't and if I wanted a cross platform app.

### What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?
From this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH1BUoxa7iI). One feature that Focus Bear doesn't is a visualisation of tasks. Tiimo has a visual planner that helps visualise tasks to be done each day, making it easier to read and track what tasks have been done or need to be done. Additionally, it uses AI to help users plan their days out, simplifying the process. It also allows users to import their existing calendars, making it easier for new users to get started with the app.

### Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?
I think Focus Bear could make use of AI. It could be used like Tiimo's to help users plan out their days by scheduling tasks. It can also be used to analyse a user's habits offering suggestions and changes a user can make to their habits in order to effectively use the app.

I also would like to see imports of reminders or calendars to be implemented, this would immensely simplify a user's ability to start using the app and hopefully keep users using it.
