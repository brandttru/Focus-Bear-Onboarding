# Set Up Dev Productivity Chrome Extensions
### Which extensions did you install? Why?
React Developer Tools allows for inspection of the component hierarchies directly in the browser. This can make it easier to debug pages by looking directly at the components as they are displayed on the page without checking the code. It additionally shows component props, states and hooks.

Redux DevTools allows a user to see the change in states on a page. This is helpful for debugging as it shows the different state changes as the page is being interacted with, making it easier to spot problematic states.

JSON Viewer Pro formats and colour codes JSON from APIs for easier readability. It also includes both a chart and tree view. This is useful when working with APIs and to quickly see what the JSON response is.

Lighthouse audits web apps for performance, accessibility, SEO and best practices. This is useful as it measures how an app performs and can help see what areas can be improved.

### What was the most useful thing you learned?
I learnt that these tools existed. Prior to this, I had no idea these tools existed and was just running pages and cross checking with the code for points of concern. This was an issue for me in one univeristy project where I was designing a web app. It was not effective, as I often had pages with hundreds of lines of code and I had to scan these files everytime to see where an error could be present. Now that I am aware of these tools, I will use them to improve my productivity and workflow.
