#  Set Up a Terminal Client & Get Comfortable with the Command Line
### Which terminal client did you choose? Why?
I am using Windows Powershell and Command Prompt. This is because I have used it in the past and feel comfortable with it.

### What customizations (if any) did you make?
I did not make any customisations as I do not use it often enough to justify going out of my way to customise it.

### What was the most useful command you learned today?
driverquery /FO list /v

This is useful to see what drivers are installed on the current device. Can be useful to see what's installed but not in use. Great way to free up space.
