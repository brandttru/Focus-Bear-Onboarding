## Shortcuts
### Navigating
``Ctrl + ` `` to open the terminal
`Ctrl + f` to find text
`Ctrl + e` to search files
`Ctrl + T` to reopen last closed file

### Editing
`Alt + z` to enable text wrap
`Shift + Tab` to unindent a text selection
`Alt + UP/DOWN` to move a line up/down
`Ctrl + L` to select all occurences of a word
`Alt + O` to remove all unused imports
 `Alt + Click` to add multiple cursors

### Terminal
`Ctrl + c` to kill current terminal process

### Which shortcuts do you think will be the most useful in your daily work?
`Shift + Tab` will be useful as indenting is key to making text readable and can streamline the process of unindenting large lines of code.
`Ctrl + c` is useful when running processes in the terminal. As terminal processes are usually used for testing and debugging, anything that is stuck or takes too long can instantly be killed and then I can return to fixing it. For example, in a recent uni assignment where I had to code Pacman, I would acciodentally code algorithms that caused infinite loops and thus when testing in the terminal I needed to kill the process to retest my solution.

### How can keyboard shortcuts improve your productivity?
As both of our hands are used for the keyboard, being able to use the keyboard for things that normally require the mouse will reduce the amount of times I have to take my hand off the keyboard and use the mouse. This time saved adds up, overall streamlining my workflow.
