# Git Setup & Document Your Knowledge
### Git version
I am on:
git version 2.48.1.windows.1

### Have you used Git before? If so, in what context?
Yes I have used Git before at uni. I will use it each semester for almost all my units. As a software engineering student I can't not be using Git.

### Which Git client (if any) did you choose? Why?
I did not use a Git client. This is because I find that using the website and VS Code's built in features are enough for what I want to do. I have never needed anything more complex than being able to push and pull code.

### What was the most interesting thing you learned about Git today?
Git is really useful for working across multiple devices and storing work over the cloud. Best part is its free to use.
