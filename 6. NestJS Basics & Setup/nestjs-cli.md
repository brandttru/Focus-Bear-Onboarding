# Using NestJS CLI for Scaffolding
## Tasks
### Generate a new controller, service, and module using the CLI
Created a new app using CLI under nestapp

### Explore additional CLI commands like nest generate and nest build
`nest generate` - uses schematics to scaffold or modify files. Can help generate modules, controllers, providers etc
`nest build` - compiles the NestJS app for deployment

### Understand how the CLI helps with the modular architecture of NestJS
Since CLI scaffolds an app, it can help ensure that the modular architecture of NestJS is upheld. It can also automatically wire dependencies when generating controller, modules, providers etc, reducing human error.

## Reflection
### How does the NestJS CLI help streamline development?
By enforcing modular archiecture through scaffolding, CLI makes development more convenient. This can be seen in the scaffolding as well as its ability to automatically wire dependencies which removes human error, saving debugging time.

### What is the purpose of nest generate?
`nest generate` creates new files that follow the structure of NestJS. For example, a module can be generated and will be placed into src with appropriate file name. A controller for that module can then be generated and be automatically added to the module. The same applies to service.

### How does using the CLI ensure consistency across the codebase?
Since it is automatically generated, it can ensure that rules of NestJS are followed and that structure of the codebase is predictable. It also ensures consistent file naming and location.

### What types of files and templates does the CLI create by default?
A mock up of file structure generated by ChatGPT (some files are missing)
```
my-app/
├── src/
│   ├── app.controller.spec.ts   👈 Unit test template for the controller
│   ├── app.controller.ts        👈 Default controller (handles routes)
│   ├── app.module.ts            👈 Root module (entry point for all modules)
│   ├── app.service.ts           👈 Default service (business logic)
│   └── main.ts                  👈 Application bootstrap file
├── test/
│   └── app.e2e-spec.ts          👈 End-to-end test example
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
├── nest-cli.json
└── README.md
```

By default, CLI will create the minimum src files, test files, the required dependencies, linting as well as a README
