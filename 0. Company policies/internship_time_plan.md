# Time Plan
There may be some errors at the start because I didn't start with the right milestone, forget to use the app, semester ending etc

I will be tracking my time using a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PnAJ_KpIfyaWTwy4rXaUgm9IwsXOAXLEm_omC-CBkxA/edit?usp=sharing) aiming to complete 10 hours per week (after the semester ends).

## Schedule
My planned schedule is: 
- Monday 14:00 - 16:00
- Tuesday 12:00 - 16:00, 18:00 - 20:00
- Thursday 14:00 - 16:00

I will aim to follow this schedule and if necessary, will work outside of these hours to ensure I meet my own quota of 10 hours per week.

## Location
I will be working at home on my desktop computer.
