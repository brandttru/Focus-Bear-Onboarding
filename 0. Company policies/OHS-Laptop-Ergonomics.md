# Occupational Health & Safety (OHS) for Desk-Based Work
## Research and Learn
### What are the risks of using a laptop without an external monitor or keyboard?
You will develop bad posture due to wanting to avoid neck strain, eye strain or wrist pain.

### What ergonomic equipment can improve posture when working on a laptop? (e.g., laptop stands, external keyboards, ergonomic chairs)
Laptop stands, external keyboards, chairs, standing/adjustable desk.

### What adjustments should be made to monitor height, chair position, and desk setup for a healthier workspace?
Monitor should be eye level adn at a decent distance away. Chair should be high enough so that wrist and shoulders are relaxed.

### What are some daily habits that reduce the impact of prolonged laptop use? (e.g., movement breaks, posture checks, eye strain reduction techniques)
- Occassionally look away from the screen
- Stretch
- Walk around for a bit

## Reflection
### What equipment changes can you make to improve your workspace setup? (e.g., using an external monitor, adjusting your chair, using a laptop stand)
Keep desk and chair at an appropriate height

### What behavioural changes can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain? (e.g., sitting upright, taking regular breaks, adjusting screen height)
Take more breaks during work sessions - walking around or stretching.

### How can you remind yourself to maintain good posture and take breaks throughout the day? (Hint: Use Focus Bear to schedule movement breaks!)
Using Focus Bear!

## Task
### Adjust your laptop setup based on ergonomic best practices.
I adjusted my monitor height so that the top is at eye level, as seen in this photo I took at eye level.

### Identify at least one piece of equipment that could improve your posture and comfort.
Standing desk - I already have one, but could be using it more effectively such as by standin more often

### Document at least one workspace change or habit adjustment you made.
Adjusting the monitor height has forced me to sit up right when looking at my monitor. My neck and back no longer slouch and I find that I can sit down for longer without any soreness.
