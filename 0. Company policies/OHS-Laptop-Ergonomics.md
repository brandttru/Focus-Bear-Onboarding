# Occupational Health & Safety (OHS) for Desk-Based Work
## Research and Learn
### What are the risks of using a laptop without an external monitor or keyboard?
You will develop bad posture due to wanting to avoid neck strain, eye strain or wrist pain.

### What ergonomic equipment can improve posture when working on a laptop? (e.g., laptop stands, external keyboards, ergonomic chairs)
Laptop stands, external keyboards, chairs, standing/adjustable desk.

### What adjustments should be made to monitor height, chair position, and desk setup for a healthier workspace?
Monitor should be eye level adn at a decent distance away. Chair should be high enough so that wrist and shoulders are relaxed.

### What are some daily habits that reduce the impact of prolonged laptop use? (e.g., movement breaks, posture checks, eye strain reduction techniques)
- Occassionally look away from the screen
- Stretch
- Walk around for a bit

## Reflection
### What equipment changes can you make to improve your workspace setup? (e.g., using an external monitor, adjusting your chair, using a laptop stand)
Keep desk and chair at an appropriate height

### What behavioural changes can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain? (e.g., sitting upright, taking regular breaks, adjusting screen height)
Take more breaks during work sessions - walking around or stretching.

### How can you remind yourself to maintain good posture and take breaks throughout the day? (Hint: Use Focus Bear to schedule movement breaks!)
Using Focus Bear!

## Task
### Identify at least one piece of equipment that could improve your posture and comfort.
Standing desk - I already have one, but could be using it more effectively

### Document at least one workspace change or habit adjustment you made.
Used Focus Bear!!!
