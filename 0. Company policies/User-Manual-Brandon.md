# Creating Your "User Manual for Me"
## Research and Learn
### What is a “User Manual for Me”, and why do teams use them?
A personal document that helps a user understand others understand how to work with them. Teams use them so they can understand how to best work with others especially when they are working with unfamiliar people.

### What categories are helpful to include? (e.g., communication style, work habits, feedback preferences)
Some useful categories are:
- communication style
- times and hours
- things that I like/dislike

### How can writing a personal user manual improve teamwork and reduce misunderstandings?
Some people may be difficult to figure out how to work with others. As such, having a manual will make it easier for them to figure someone out and get straight into working with them.


# User Manual for Brandon

## My role

- Monday 14:00 - 16:00
- Tuesday 12:00 - 16:00, 18:00 - 20:00
- Thursday 14:00 - 16:00

## How I Work Best  
- I do my best work when: 
    - I am alone in a quiet space and can block out distractions
    - I plan out my deadlines
    - Understand the task at hand
- I struggle when:
    - My mental is bad (bad test score, my favourite team loses a game)
    - The task is outside of my comfort zone (difficult, unfamiliar)

## Communication Style  
- I prefer messages to be short and not too formal. You can text me like a friend - I prefer a back and forth conversation
- The best way to reach me is:
    1. Discord - I will always have this open on my desktop
    2. Email - I occassionally check it during the day
- If you need something urgent, do this:
    - Send a message and make it clear its urgent so I can tell from the notification

## Collaboration & Teamwork  
- I work best in a team when:
    - Everyone in the team is equally as motivated as I am and we can motivate each other
    - Everyone is willing to listen to each other
    - Everyone frequently messages and it is easy to tell that someone is participating
- My biggest pet peeve in teamwork is:
    - People who ghosts communication and don't bother with communicating
    - Even when they are present, they don't participate and let other people do the talking
- If I seem quiet in a meeting, it usually means:
    - I am looking for a way to intrude into the conversation
    - I am thinking of something to contribute with

## Focus & Productivity  
- I stay focused by:
    - Listening to music
    - Working in a quiet space
- Things that distract me:
    - Loud spaces
- The best way to support my productivity is:
    - Not bother me

## Feedback & Growth  
- I like feedback to be:
    - Direct and to the point
    - Honest and reasonable
    - Specific issues are stated and ways of improvement are suggested
- When I make a mistake, the best way to let me know is;
    - As soon as it is made
    - And with suggestions to correct it
- I appreciate it when teammates:
    - Give me honest feedback
    - Can help me when I ask questions
    - Willing to discuss solutions to problems

## Fun Facts & Quirks  
- One thing people often misunderstand about me is:
    - Not sure, people have never really told me they thought differently of me
- A fun fact about me:
    - I love music and collect CDs of my favourite artists
- My work superpower is:
    - I love teaching (even do it as a casual job as a tutor), so if I ever get the chance to I will explain something and do my best to explain it well
