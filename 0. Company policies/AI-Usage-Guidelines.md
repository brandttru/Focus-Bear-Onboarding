# Use of AI Tools
## Research and Learn
### What AI tools are typically used for your role?
Copilot, Claude, Chat GPT, Cursor

### What are the benefits and risks of using AI in a professional setting?
AI can help speed up work flow, find mistakes, summarise/help you learn about something. However, someone may be over reliant on it and end up having their skills degrade. AI also is not entirely accurate and and may give the wrong information.

### What types of information should never be entered into AI tools?
Sensitive information such as name, address, driver's license, passport number. Company data should also not be entered such as source code or financial data.

### How can you fact-check and validate AI-generated content to ensure accuracy?
Verify with other online sources, making sure they are reliable. Make sure logically the response is sound.

## Reflection
### When should you use AI for assistance, and when should you rely on your own skills?
AI should be used when you are unsure of the task or as a starting point. It can also be used to make tasks easier/faster such as spotting mistakes. Your skills should be used to refine what has been given by AI. Personal tasks such as reflections should entirely be done yourself.

### How can you avoid over-reliance on AI while still benefiting from it?
Get into the habit of questioning AI. Do not entirely copy the response given, instead understand the response given and rewrite it so that it doesn't sound like AI wrote it.

### What steps will you take to ensure data privacy when using AI tools?
Stop blindly copy and pasting into AI and ensure that anything that may be sensitive pasted into AI is either censored or removed.

## Task
### Identify one task you can improve using an AI tool, and try it out.
Since I usually use lots of spreadsheets. I used AI to help me create a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ODJYT3Rekm9CNhDmow4rOBkdeE9J4qtTyiXYhqoLebk/edit?usp=sharing) as well as its formulas.

### Review the AI-generated output criticallyâ€”did it require editing or fact-checking?
It had a lot of trouble getting the formulas correct and required a lot of attempts. The main issue seems to be how it interprets prompts. You have to be a lot more literal when talking to AI.
