# Working with Vulnerable Populations
## Research and Learn
### Who are considered vulnerable populations, and what challenges might they face in digital spaces?
- Children
- Elder
- People with disabilities
- Minority people
- Non native speakers
- Victims of abuse or trauma

They may face exclusion, exploitation or abuse.

### What ethical considerations are important when designing or working with neurodivergent individuals? (Hint: Avoid overwhelming UX, respect sensory needs, ensure clear communication.)
- Keep UI simple
- Include accessibility features or considerations (colour blind colours, text to speech, large buttons, etc)
- Promote inclusivity

### How can you make interactions and content more accessible for people with ADHD or Autism? (e.g., simple language, predictable navigation, reducing cognitive load)
- Use simple and clear language
- Reduce cognitive overload
- Encourage a calm and safe experience
- Convey information in multiple ways

### How can we support neurodivergent team members in a professional setting? (Hint: Be clear in communication, respect different working styles, and allow flexibility.)
- Communicate clearly
- Be respectful and patient with them
- Understand their needs

## Reflection
### How can you adjust your communication style to be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates?
I can be a lot clearer about what I want to communicate, as well as be more patient of people who do not understand me.

### What are some common UX or communication pitfalls that might make Focus Bear less accessible or supportive?
- Complex interfaces
- Inconsistent and unintuitive behaviour and UI
- Ambiguous language
- Lack of flexibility and locking users out of their freedom

### What is one practical change you can make in your work to better support vulnerable populations?
One change I can do is be more careful with the language I use. Use language that is easier to understand and clearly conveys my itentions.

## Task
### Read a first-person account from someone with ADHD or Autism about their experiences with productivity tools. (Hint: Look for blog posts, videos, or community discussions.)

### Identify one design or communication improvement that could make Focus Bear more accessible.
When first opening the app, I find it a bit overwhelming. Maybe we can add widgets for the features we do want since I cannot see myself using all of these.

### Practice writing a clear, patient, and supportive response to a hypothetical user struggling with executive functioning.
Don't give up! We are struggle sometimes and that's okay. Take your time. It's the results that matter not the method.
