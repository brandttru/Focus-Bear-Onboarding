# Cyber Security
## Research and Learn
### What are common cyber security threats in a remote work environment?
Phishing, social engineering, weak passwords, unsecure wifi networks

### What are best practices for keeping your devices and accounts secure?
Some good practices include:
- Setting passwords on devices
- If leaving devices unattended close them never leave them unlocked
- Create strong passwords (use extensions, don't use common passwords etc)
- Use unique passwords for each account
- Use 2FA
- Update passwords frequently

### Why is it important to lock your computer when away from your desk?
Anyone can go up to your computer and use it. They can look through your folders, go through your browsers for any saved passwords or log in to any of your accounts and use them.

### How should you handle phishing attempts and suspicious links?
Double check the sender's name, email, phone number and the contents of the phishing attempt. DO NOT click on any suspicious links. There are some tools that can be used to check if a link leads you to another site. Even attachments are not safe and should not be opened unless the sender is trustworthy. Make sure to report the sender when all is said and done.

### What makes a strong password, and why should you use a password manager?
Strong passwords:
- Are long (12-16 characters)
- Use lower case, upper case, numbers, special characters
- Do not repeat characters
- Do not use common patterns (e.g. 123456, qwerty)

Password managers should be used as they encourage unique passwords across accounts due to its ability to store and auto fill passwords for you. This means you do not have to remember them or struggle with coming up with one.

### Why is two-factor authentication (2FA) important, and when should you enable it?
2FA is important because in the rare case that someone is able to figure out your password it then must pass through an additional layer of security. Commonly this is through a verification code being sent to your phone number, which is almost impossible to bypass unless your phone is not with you. It should always be enabled.

## Reflection
### What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?
Currently I use 2FA whenever possible and create strong passwords using a mix of different characters. I sometimes am prone to reusing passwords and can definitely use a password manager to improve this.

### How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?
Habit can only be developed through knowledge of the issue. Once you know about the dangers of something you can take the steps to mitigate it.

### What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?
I will use a password manager and update my passwords frequently, around once a year.

### What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?
Attempt to regain access to my account, change passwords, and if necessary (such as bank account breach) make a call and see what they can do about it.

## Task
### Document one new cyber security habit you will follow at Focus Bear.
I will follow locking devices when away from them and set up auto lock.
