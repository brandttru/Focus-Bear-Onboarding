### How do these roles collaborate in Kanban vs. Scrum?
The main difference between the roles in Kanban vs Scrum is that in Kanban it is more continuous and there is continuous development made during the project. In Scrum, the roles work within a set time frame to ensure that things are completed strictly per sprint.

## Reflection
### What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?
My role as a developer contributes during the sprints, ensuring that by the end of a sprint, some progression is made

### How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?
With QA, I must write code and features that can easily be understood during testing. With PM, I must ensure I am implementing the correct features according to requirements. With Agile PM, I must follow their guidelines and ensure a productive workflow during sprints.

## Task
### Write a short description of how your role fits into the Agile team.
In an agile team, the developer is responsible for the development of the product. They are expected to completed their tasks allocated for each sprint. They must also ensure that they implement requirements according to the wishes of the client. The code must be understandable and maintainable to allow for effective testing. They must also actively participate in the agile methedology.

### Identify one other role you frequently collaborate with and describe how you can improve teamwork with them.
QA is an often collaborator. Some ways of improving teamwork with them could be to be in contact with them regarding what how the want the code to be written. Another way is using CI/CD pipelines to streamline the QA testing process, making work easier for both teams.
