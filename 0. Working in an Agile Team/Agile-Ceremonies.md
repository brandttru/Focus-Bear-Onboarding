# Agile Ceremonies & Team Collaboration
## Research and Learn
### What are the main Agile ceremonies, and what is their purpose?
- Daily Stand ups
    - Check in to see what everyone's current progress is and any issues they have
    - Encourages communicaiton
- Sprint Planning (Scrum) vs. Continuous Prioritization (Kanban)
    - Sprint planning is planning how a sprint will go (tasks to be done)
    - Continuous prioritisation is deciding on priority of tasks and ensuring highest priority is done first
- Retrospectives
    - Review what went well in the previous sprint and what didn't go well
    - A chance to learn from mistakes and improve for the next sprint
- Backlog refinement
    - Ongoing process of reviewing, clarifying, and prioritizing work items in the product backlog

### How do Agile teams collaborate asynchronously and across time zones?
Teams can use digital tracking collaboration tools, asynchronous communication channels, plan real time events during the most appropriate times

## Reflection
### How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?
Ceremonies can ensure that teams are aware of what each other are doing and keep people in contact with each other. It can also reveal who's progress is slowed down and thus others can help them.

### Which ceremony do you think is most important for your role, and why?
Daily stand ups are important for developers, as development is a continuous progress that requires the effort of many people. Due to some features being coupled with others, developers must be in constant contact with each other to ensure smooth workflow during sprints.
