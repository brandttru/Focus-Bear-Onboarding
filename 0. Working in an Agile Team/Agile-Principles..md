# Working in an Agile Team
## Research and Learn
### What is Agile, and how does it differ from traditional project management?
Agile is a project management process where work is divided into smaller parts allowing for continuous project iteration.

### What are the core values and principles of Agile? (Hint: Check the Agile Manifesto.)
The principles can be found in the [manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)

### What are the differences between Scrum and Kanban, and when is each used?
Scrum = A lot more structured, roles are defined and internal deadlines (sprints) must be met, regular meeting times
Kanban = Roles are fluid, no strict deadlines, tasks can be done in whatever order or priority

Scrum is more suited for projects where there is a defined and predictable timeline, meaning a strict project cycle can be followed. Kanban is better suited for projects where there is less of a planned timeline and flexibility is required.

### Why does Focus Bear lean towards Kanban instead of Scrum?
As Focus Bear is an ever growing app, its unpredictable timeline aligns more with Scrum's focus on flexibility and continuous work flow.

## Reflection
### What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?
Benefits = Allows for iterative work to be produced, consistent development and clients can see different iterations and offer more feedback incrementally
Challenges = Learning curve, team must be well aware of their responsiblities, requires communication between all team members

### How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?
Agile can improve with feedback and improvement through its iterative nature. It can also simplify the task at hand by breaking it down into smaller tasks, improving workflow.

### Summarize the main differences between Scrum and Kanban in your own words.
The main difference between Scrum and Kanban is in the hierarchy of responsibility. Scrum's more structured process requires delegation of roles where some are more important than others to ensure project delivery. Kanban, however, does not usually have defined roles and everyone involved has shared responbilities.

### Identify one Agile principle you think will be most useful in your work.
"Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential."

This will help ensure that I am efficient with my individual tasks, wasting less time and allowing me to move onto other tasks. Thus, allowing me to complete more tasks.
