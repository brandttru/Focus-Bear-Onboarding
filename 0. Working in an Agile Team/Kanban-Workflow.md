# Agile Workflows & Kanban
## Research and Learn
### How does a Kanban board work, and how does it help manage workflow?
Kanban boards visually show where tasks are in their development cycle. 

E.g. To do -> In progress -> In review -> Done

It helps teams visualise progress and priority of tasks.

### What do the different columns on a Kanban board represent? (e.g., Backlog, In Progress, Blocked, Done)
Backlog = It is a backlog item and has not been started yet
In progress = It is currently being worked on
Blocked = It cannot be complete until blockers have been removed
Done = It is done and can be removed from the backlog

### How do tasks move through the board, and who is responsible for updating them?
Tasks move according to where the task is in the development cycle. At first, PM is responsible for adding tasks from the backlog to the board. Developers who work on a task will update the progress accordingly. If any issues are found by QA the task will become blocked. The Agile PM will oversee board progress overall.

### What are the benefits of limiting work in progress (WIP)?
Developers can focus on fewer tasks as opposed to having many tasks at once that can become overwhelming and hinder the start of tasks.

## Reflection
### How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?
Kanban helps visualise the progress of tasks. It helps developers focus on fewer tasks at once rather than multiple tasks, ensuring more work is complete iteratively.

### How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?
Kanban can help break down tasks into smaller subtasks, helping chip away at the entire task and reducing the burden of starting such a large task.

## Task
### Check out Focus Bearâ€™s Kanban board and note how tasks are structured. (Hint: Look in GitHub Projects.)
I don't have access to Focus Bear's Kanban board but I was able to make my [own](https://github.com/users/brandttru/projects/1) and experimented with making an issue and moving it around the board.

### Identify one way you can improve task tracking in your role.
I need to remember to consistently use the Kanban Board, making changes according to updates in task progress no matter how little. By getting into this habit, I can then get used to ensuring task tracking is done consistently and accurately.
