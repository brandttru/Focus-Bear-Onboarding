# When to Use Google, AI Tools, or Ask for Help?
## Tasks
### Research best practices for troubleshooting coding problems.
- Understand problem thoroughly
    - Error messages, logs
- Before and after changes
    - Check output before and after changes
    - What change caused the error?
    - What change fixed the error?
- Comment out code
- Use debug tools
- Ask for help
    - From my chat with ChatGPT:
        - AI can boost productivity by writing baseline code, so you can focus on complex code
        - AI can help break down code, explain the problem
        - AI is ineffective at working on more complex and intricate code or code that requires knowledge of company works
        - AI is also not the creative
        - AI can lead to overreliance and detoriating skills
    - People also working on the code

### Develop a decision-making framework

## Reflection
### When do you prefer using AI vs. searching Google?
For simpler questions I search Google as there is a high chance that there is an up to date solution for my issue. However, I find AI to be better at harder and not as simple questions. This is because I can question the reponse it gives me and ask it to explain or summarise anything, which is easier than Google where I cannot question the answers.

### How do you decide when to ask a colleague instead?
For me, when I absolutely cannot find an answer on Google or with AI, then I will ask a colleague. In some cases I will ask at the start if its something I'm unfamiliar with and need something to get me started with.

### What challenges do developers face when troubleshooting alone?
I find that a huge setback for troubleshooting alone is that you have no one else to question you or discuss with you. For example, if I want to solve a problem with an alogrithm, I find it best to discuss with others about the pros and cons and maybe some alternatives. Using AI or Google for this task hinders the creativity needed to innovate a solution.
